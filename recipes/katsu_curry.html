    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Curry Sauce:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium potatos, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>31/2 cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) container curry sauce mix</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apricot jam</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Chicken Katsu</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add onions to the hot oil and fry until soft and starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes.
             Add potatoes and carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until potatoes are soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and add curry sauce mix; stir well until all pieces are dissolved. If you'd like to add seasonings, add ketchup, Worcestershire, jam, and soy sauce. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or longer if you'd like it thicker.</li>
        <li>While the curry is infusing, flatten the chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Season with salt and pepper. Drench in flour, then egg, and then coat generously with panko bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a separate saucepan to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully lower breaded cutlets into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, stir 1 teaspoon curry powder into the sauce.</li>
        <li>Slice cooked chicken into strips and spoon curry sauce over top.</li>
    </ol>
